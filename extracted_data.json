            "Description": "What is the CHIP scheme?The CHIP scheme aims to help Lincolnshire families keep their children safe from home accidents. Accidents in and around the home are a leading cause of preventable death and disability for children under 5 years old.How does the CHIP scheme work?Home safety interventions that include a combination of home safety assessment, parent education and provision and fitting of safety equipment can be effective in preventing child accidents in the home.The CHIP scheme provides a range of resources to staff and volunteers working with families so they can support families with accident prevention. There's also an equipment fitting service that families can be referred to if they need safety equipment.CHIP AssessmentThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend that homes with children under 5 have a 'structured home safety assessment' to identify and address any child injury risks in the home.The purpose of the CHIP assessment is help practitioners:take a systematic approach to identifying child injury risk in the homegive consistent safety advice according to the latest evidence, andkeep a record of identified risks and the action taken to mitigate them.The assessment looks at risks associated with developmental milestones as there's a strong link between the types of accidents children are involved in and their stage of development.It also takes a Sign of Safety approach, encouraging families to think about what's working well and what actions can be taken to make their children safer.The CHIP assessment can be downloaded at the bottom of the page. It comes with a guide containing all the safety messages relating to each question on the assessment.You can complete theassessment onlineand on submission a copy will be sent to your email address. It's also available on Mosaic so it can be added to a child/family's record.CHIP TrainingParent education plays an important role in preventing child accidents in the home. Staff and volunteers working with families are in a great position to educate parents and carers about child injuries and how they can be prevented.The CHIP e-learning module is a must-do for anyone who works with children under 5 years of age or supports families with children under 5. It takes around 20 minutes and by the end practitioners will be able to:Identify what causes the most common and serious injuries in the under 5s and what can be done to prevent themExplain the link between child development and injuriesFind useful resources to help you prevent accidents.Here's how to access the course:Go to:https://safeguardinglincolnshire.vc-enable.co.uk. \u00a0Instructions of how to register are attached.Click 'Learning'Click 'Available learning'Type 'Chip' into search bar. 'Child Home Injury Prevention (CHIP) E-Learning' will appearClick 'Start' and then click 'Start' againClick 'Download' and then open the PowerPointClick 'Slide Show' once in the document and click through it using the mouse or spacebarOnce finished, click 'Next' in the e-learning site and it'll take you to a quiz. Complete the quiz to gain a certificate.CHIP VisitsClickhereto refer.Please read the information below before referring.Be aware that the fire service is operating a reduced home visiting service at the moment, and only high risk cases will be considered for a CHIP visit. You can submit your referral and the fire service will make arrangements to visit once services return to normal. If you feel that the case is high risk \u2013 i.e. there's an imminent and high risk of child injury and the installation of equipment can reduce that risk \u2013 then please emailchips@lincolnshire.gov.ukwith your referral with further information.CHIP Visits are provided by Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue (LFR). Upon referral, LFR will visit the household and supply/fit safety equipment as necessary. This may include:Safety gates(to prevent access to and falls on stairs)Window restrictors(to prevent falls from windows)Fire guards(to prevent access to open fires)Cupboard locks(to prevent access to cupboards containing medicines and poisonous household chemicals)Blind cord cleats(to prevent access to blind cords which could cause entanglement and suffocation)Hair-straightener pouches(to prevent burns from hot hair straighteners)They will also undertake a home fire safety check which includes escape planning with the family and installation of smoke or CO alarms, if needed.Referrals for CHIP Visits can only be made byEarly Help Workers,Early Years Practitioners,Health Visitors,Family Health WorkersandSocial Workers.The referral form will ask for a copy of the household's CHIP Assessment. This demonstrates the need for equipment and evidences that home safety has been discussed with the family.It\u2019s important to note that LFR's responsibility is to assess for and fit safety equipment according to manufacturer's instructions and best practice. It is not LFR's responsibility to educate parents about accident prevention \u2013this is the responsibility of the referring practitioner.Evidence shows that the provision and installation of safety equipment is only successful in preventing injuries when combined with parent education. The CHIP e-learning and assessment tool are designed to support practitioners with this.CHIP Visits are targeted at households where children are at greatest risk of injury. The following characteristics indicate that a child may be at high risk:They live in areas of deprivationThey live in rented accommodation, poor quality housing or homes of multiple occupancyTheir parents are unemployed or have never workedTheir parent\u2019s ability to supervise is impaired (i.e. due to mental health problems, health/care needs, substance misuse, number of children in property)They have young or single parents with poor support networksTheir parents can\u2019t afford safety equipment.The following eligibility criteria is therefore applied. The child/family must be on:Child protection planChild in Need assessment/planEarly Support Care Co-ordination (ESCO)Team Around the Child (TAC) planIncome Based Jobseekers Allowance; Income Related Employment Support Allowance; Income Support. Also including Universal CreditWorking Tax Credits or Child Tax CreditsDisability Living Allowance or Personal Independence PaymentsHousing Benefit or Council Tax BenefitSome points to consider before referring:Ensure you have consent of the parent/carerIf the parent/carer is a tenant they will need to have permission from their landlordBe aware that LFR will not install safety gates unless there is a child aged less than 24 months in the propertyYou will be notified with details of action taken during the visit. Please retain this in the child/family record.Useful resourcesChild Milestone Cards.Lincolnshire County Council has produced 6 child milestone cards for families to remember and celebrate their child's first developmental milestones (see Downloads).

Through the Internship, 16\u201324-year-olds gain work experience, develop independence skills and increase their employability.What we do:Our service is bespoke, offering tailored support to each Intern, and employment opportunities are matched to the individual\u2019s skills. Project Choice aims to empower Interns and build their confidence as individuals in the workplace, while also offering life experience beyond their home and school environments.The programme aims to provide young people with the skills and opportunities to enable them to progress into paid employment at the end of the yearlong internship programme, working within a wide range of public, private and independent sector departments/ areas.What is the engagement process?Project Choice holds formal awareness sessions at schools and other local authority venues, but we are also happy to come and speak with interested young people and parents and/or carers in other settings, e.g. at home or school on a one-to-one basis.Who can apply for the Internship?The Internship is for 16\u201324-year-olds with learning difficulties, disabilities and/or Autism. There are no academic requirements to join the Internship, however individuals will need to have an aspiration to work and a current Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP) in place. Project Choice will need to be named in the EHCP, so parents and/or carers will need to be in discussion with the local commissioning authority for this to be arranged.What is the assessment process?Potential interns will be invited to a fun day for us to meet the young person and assess whether Project Choice can meet their needs.How long is the Internship?The Internship comprises up to three placements, lasting 10-12 weeks each, throughout the academic year.
